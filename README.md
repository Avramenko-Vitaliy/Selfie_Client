# Selfie_Client
The Concurrent Daily Selfie application is an extension of one of the mini-projects in Professor Porterâ€™s MOOCs, which enables users to take pictures of themselves - selfies - over an extended period of time. It periodically reminds the user to take a selfie and presents the selfies in a list that makes it easy to see how the user has changed over time. This extended implementation also allows users to process their selfies to add effects, such as blurring or charcoaling. The image processing is done via a remote web service. In addition, all interactions between the device and the remote web service should be done concurrently in the background to ensure that the UI thread on the device is not interrupted.
